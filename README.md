##About

This stylesheet is meant to be used in conjunction with Google Code Prettify. For more info on Google Code Prettify, see [http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/]()

It was inspired by the Oblivion theme on Gedit, the default GNOME text editor. For more info about Gedit, see [http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/]()

Simply include the file with the rest of your CSS, and you should be good to go :)
